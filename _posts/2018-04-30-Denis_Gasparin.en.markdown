<h5>Denis Gasparin speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the talks "PostgreSQL Tips & Tricks" and "Machine Learning with PostGreSQL", Denis Gasparin will be at PGDay.IT 2018 edition.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Denis, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>I approached PostgreSQL in 2001 when, having to choose a DBMS for a new project, I was looking for a database server supporting referential integrity and the ability to execute DDL in transaction.
I did choose PostgreSQL 7.1 and since then I used PostgreSQL on all the projects I have developed.

<h6>Denis, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>I attended the Italian PGDay since the first edition. Since 2014 I partecipated as a speaker, the first time with a lightning talk (I invite everyone to prepare at least one!) and then with several talks on the use of PostgreSQL.

<h6>Denis, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Simple, safe and scalable ... without forgetting its fantastic community!

<h6>About Denis Gasparin</h6>

PostgreSQL, in addition to being a complete and reliable database, reserves many surprises and 'hidden' features that we will discover in this talk.

In particular we'll discover:

• some "unconventional" data types

• extravagant queries

• psql for brave elephants

• precious indices

• unique extensions

Intrigued? Do not miss this talk, you will be surprised at what our Elephant can do!

<h6>Talk: Machine Learning with PostgreSQL</h6>
[Riva room: ore 16,50 pm - Language: Ialiano - Complexity: Intermediate](https://2018.pgday.it/it/schedule/#session-018)

Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM and many others offer software and libraries for Machine Learning.

And what PostgreSQL  can do?

The talk will cover MADLib installation and some usage examples for natural language analysis.
