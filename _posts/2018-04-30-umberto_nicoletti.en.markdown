<h5>Umberto Nicoletti speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the talks "Fun (and profit) with ZFS and Postgres", Umberto Nicoletti will be at PGDay.IT edition 2018.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Umberto, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>I started using Postgres in important contexts having to support opennms, which still uses PostgreSQL as databases.
In Proemion we use Postgres as a database for our telematics solution.

<h6>Umberto, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>I had the talk already ready and it seemed like a context where it could be interesting to propose it again.
I'd like to meet other people who use Postgres on ZFS.

<h6>Umberto, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Data integrity, performance, ecosystem.

<h6>Talk: Fun (and profit) with ZFS and Postgres</h6>
[Riva room: 11,05 am - Language: Italian - Complexity: Intermediate](https://2018.pgday.it/en/schedule/)

ZFS is a filesystem, originally developed for Solaris, that finally brings advanced filesystem features (compression, snapshots, and checksums, among others) to Linux. I selected the ZFS-on-Linux port as the key component of an internal tool created with the purpose of better supporting the team in all those scenarios where a replica of the production Postgres database might be required: testing query optimizations, database migrations, etc. While it was a lot of fun for me to work on it, the tool proved, most importantly, to be extremely useful to the whole team. The presentation dives into the technical details of the tool, introduces ZFS key features, why one would want to use it, and then explores some other interesting ZFS use cases.
