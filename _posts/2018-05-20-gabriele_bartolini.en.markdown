<h5>Gabriele Bartolini speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

"Declarative data partitioning with PostgreSQL" is the title of the
talk that Gabriele Bartolini will be giving at PGDay.IT 2018.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know more about our speakers and ask them three basic questions.

<h6>Gabriele, how did you approach PostgreSQL?</h6>

> It was at the end of 90s when I was a webmaster at the City Council of Prato,
> writing CGI applications in C. After a short but intense experience with
> MySQL, thanks to University studies and the perseverance of my friend Marco
> Nenciarini, I converted myself to PostgreSQL and never looked back.

<h6>Gabriele, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

> The Italian PGDay is always something special for me, not only because I have
> been actively involved in it since the first edition (and I believe my
> contributions were very important back then), but also for the
> health atmosphere of an Open Source Community.

<h6>Gabriele, could you try and define PostgreSQL with three adjectives?</h6>

> Fast, Solid, Flexible.

<h6>Talk: Declarative data partitioning with PostgreSQL</h6>
[Riva room: 3 pm - Language: English - Complexity: Intermediate](https://2018.pgday.it/en/schedule/#session-3)

Horizontal partitioning is one of the most successful database modeling techniques for the scalability of a PostgreSQL database. After a historical excursus on the workaround already available from PostgreSQL 8.1 and based on inheritance, we will go through declarative partitioning introduced in PostgreSQL 10, with a peep of what's waiting for us in PostgreSQL 11.
