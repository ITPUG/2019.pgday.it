<h5>Leonardo Cecchi speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the workshop "Go and PostgreSQL: in & out", Leonardo Cecchi will be at PGDay.IT edition 2018 for the Workshop Day.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers and Trainer a little bit more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Leonardo, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>I approached PostgreSQL because of PostGis, which my father began to use in 2005-2006, and I was fascinated by his architecture.

<h6>Leonardo, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>Because I believe that PostgreSQL can be more popular in Italy and I think that PGDay is an excellent initiative for this purpose.

<h6>Leonardo, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Reliable, precise, fast.

<h6>About Leonardo Cecchi</h6>

In few words I can say that I and computer science have grown together. Programming has always been my passion. A passion that began when I was 6, standing next to my father, programmer, who taught me the rudiments of programming in C. At the elementary school I could write on the keyboard but not on paper! I've always been curious and I'm not enough satisfied to learn new technologies and new programming environments. Among them: Python, Java, Go, C, Haskell. Today I am part of the 2ndQuadrant Italia team because it gives me the opportunity to work on PostgreSQL, the DBMS that addresses innovative problems with a 'classic' language.

<h6>Workshop: Go and PostgreSQL: in & out</h6>
[June 28th: 9 am - Language: Italian and English](https://2018.pgday.it/en/workshop/)

In this workshop we will talk about the best features of PostgreSQL and the best features of Go. We will use the "database/sql" package to create a connection to PostgreSQL and the "lib/pq" package, which implements in Go the PostgreSQL binary protocol. We will talk about the native Go connection pooler, about "pressly/goose" to manage migrations and about "jmoiron/sqlx" to use PostgreSQL more comfortably and why usually don't need an ORM. At the end of the workshop we will have a simple web server exposing a REST API based on PostgreSQL.
