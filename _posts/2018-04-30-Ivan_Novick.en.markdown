<h5>Ivan Novick speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the talks "Greenplum Database: Evolving advances analytics on Postgres", Ivan Novick will be at PGDay.IT 2018 edition.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Ivan, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>For me PostgreSQL is a way to store and analyze structured and semi-structured data.  SQL is a language that is natural for exploring and analyzing sets of well curated and organized data and open source is what makes SQL available to the world.

<h6>Ivan, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>To support the community in Italy.  Pivotal (my employer) has a number of database customers in Italy and I would like to help grow the open source database and analytics community around PostgreSQL in Italy.  Happy to help support it and also to learn new things myself.

<h6>Ivan, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Data Integrity, Analytics, Performance!
