<h6> Welcome back! 2ndQuadrant Partner PGDay.IT 2018 </h6>

A historic partner who cannot miss events dedicated to PostgreSQL such as PGDay.IT, [2ndQuadrant](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/) has renewed its support for the 2018 edition of the Italian event dedicated to PostgreSQL (PGDay. IT).

Thanks for joining us again!

We asked [Umair Shaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umair-shahid-9458b327/), 2ndQuadrant's Head of Marketing and Products, for a comment about why he thought
appropriate for [2ndQuadrant](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/) to be a Partner of the [PGDay.IT 2018](https://2018.pgday.it/en/). This is his answer:

>In his book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," Stephen Covey suggests managing time based on two dimensions: importance and urgency. Four quadrants emerge from this classification.
The second quadrant identifies important but not urgent activities, typically represented by opportunities and investments in the future.
This mind set leads to “vision, perspective, balance, discipline, control and few crises” – i.e. you focus on your long-term vision and your ability to execute short to medium term goals is also impeccable.

>The mission of 2ndQuadrant is, in fact, to invest in the future and growth of PostgreSQL, with the aim of making it the best DBMS in the world.
For this reason, and more, we want to show our support at every event and conference dedicated to PostgreSQL through important partnerships.
