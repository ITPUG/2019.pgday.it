<h6>PG_Shuttle: the "express" for PGDay.IT 2018</h6>

Being aware that the small town of Lazise was a “risky” choice as the location for the PGDay.IT, before confirming our selection, we verified the possibility of organizing a pick-up service to make it easier for all to join in and participate in the PGDay.IT 2018.

And, then, “PG_Shuttle” was born!

The service is free and easy to get. Available only for PGDay.IT participants, the only requirement is to [fill in the appropriate form with name, surname, place, and time of arrival and departure](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcysiZlJ2rT7LsV8kU0AG8DvxD1M2WAhAjjcR1E2rhNfHI3A/viewform).

The required data, in addition to the name and surname, are the place and time of arrival.

These are the days and time slots covered by the “PG_Shuttle” to reach the venue of the PGDay.IT 2018:

* June 27th from 5pm to 9pm.
* June 28th from 5pm to 9pm.
* June 29th from 7am to 10am

It will also be possible to use the service at the end of the event, provided that you have made the booking. Around 6pm / 6.30pm, “PG_Shuttle” will wait for you outside the PGDay.IT 2018 venue to bring you back to your destination: Verona Airport, Verona Train Station, and Milan/Bergamo Orio al Serio Airport.

For those who are accompanied by their families, a minimum contribution of € 5.00 is requested for each person not enrolled in PGDay.IT 2018.
