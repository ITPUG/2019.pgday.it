<h5>Slavcho Trnkovski speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the talks "PostgreSQL High Availability using repmgr and pgbouncer", Slavcho Trnkovski will be at PGDay.IT edition 2018.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Slavcho, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>The company I work for has many projects with different database engines. Few years ago we decided that we want to move not only the new but also some of the old projects to PostgreSQL. All of the "features" we were using in Oracle are feasible in PostgreSQL as well (and more). Since then I started using PostgreSQL as DBA (setup, backup/restore, monitoring, HA setup).

<h6>Slavcho, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>I like "small" conferences where you can have more direct contact with the presenters and the audience, and you can easily exchange experience with others. I think PGDay.IT is one such event. Another reason, 2 years ago I attended "5432...MeetUs" conference and I liked it a lot, most of the presenters there are related to PGDay.IT as well.

<h6>Slavcho, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>PostgreSQL is the most advanced open-source, highly extensible, scalable relational database management system.

<h6>Talk: PostgreSQL High Availability using repmgr and pgbouncer</h6>
[Benacus room: 11,50 am - Language: English - Complexity: Intermediate](https://2018.pgday.it/en/schedule/#session-008)

In the company I work for we have implemented PostgreSQL High Availability using repmgr and pgbouncer. We have additionally prepared some custom scripts to avoid split brain situations. We are using puppet (foreman) for installing and configuring PostgreSQL, the same is used for configuring High Availability (with few manual steps). I would like to give a presentation about the setup we're doing for this High Availability solution.
