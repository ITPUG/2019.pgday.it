<h5>Pietro Partescano speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the talks "Subito Vs GDPR", Pietro Partescano will be at PGDay.IT edition 2018.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Pietro, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>Before working in Subito, I used PostgreSQL in small projects, but here (in Subito) given the volumes and business needs, I was able to fully appreciate its potential.

<h6>Pietro, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>I think it's a good time to meet where you can bring your own experience, from the perspective that can be useful to other people. Moreover it is a valid moment to compare and exchange ideas and points of view on different issues.

<h6>Pietro, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Sturdy, performing and customizable :)
