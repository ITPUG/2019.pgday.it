<h6>PGDay.IT 2018 opens the doors.</h6>

We are full of enthusiasm because the [last edition](https://2017.pgday.it/en/) has been fantastic!
Almost 200 enthusiastic attendees, interesting talks, great speakers, fantastic partners and a beautiful location. Attendees' feedbacks have been incredible!

We couldn't have asked for a better outcome.
Thanks to everybody: attendees, speakers, staff, partners and we hope to meet you again during this new edition of [PGDay.IT](https://2018.pgday.it/en/).

[PGDay.IT 2018](https://2018.pgday.it/en/) will be held in [Lazise](https://2018.pgday.it/en/logistics/) on Lake Garda on June 29th.

The location chosen is [Hotel Parchi del Garda](https://2018.pgday.it/en/logistics/). It is located between the towns of Peschiera del Garda and [Lazise](https://2018.pgday.it/en/logistics/), just 900 metres away from the lake's shore.

Our advice for you: take your time, keep the weekend to discover Lake Garda.
