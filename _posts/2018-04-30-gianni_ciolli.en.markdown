<h5>Gianni Ciolli speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With workshop "PostgreSQL Persistence" and the talks "Why Logical Replication?", Gianni Ciolli will be at PGDay.IT edition 2018.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Gianni, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>When I was working as a university researcher, PostgreSQL had an excellent reputation. I got to learn more about it later, thanks to my colleagues in 2ndQuadrant.

<h6>Gianni, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>It is a great conference, one of the oldest in its kind, and I am also keen to support ITPUG, given my past activities.

<h6>Gianni, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Reliable, Fast, Versatile.

<h6>Talk: Why Logical Replication?</h6>
[Riva room: 4,05 pm - Language: English - Complexity: Intermediate](https://2018.pgday.it/en/schedule/)

In this talk we discuss the state of the art of Logical Replication for PostgreSQL. While we begin by comparing it with Physical Replication, the core part of this presentation is to examine a few specific use cases, including selective replication and no-downtime software upgrades. Throughout the talk we will also comment on pitfalls and limitations, as they arise in various use cases.

<h6>Workshop: PostgreSQL Persistence</h6>
[June 28th - time 2 pm - Language: Italian and English](https://2018.pgday.it/en/workshop/)

In this workshop we demonstrate several aspects of data persistence in PostgreSQL, in terms of architecture, database configuration and application behaviour.
