<h5>Artur Caliendo Prado speaker at PGDay.IT 2018.</h5>

With the talks "How PostGIS changed the insurance market in Brazil", Artur Caliendo Prado will be at PGDay.IT edition 2018.

For this edition of PGDay.IT we decided to get to know our Speakers a little more, by asking three simple questions.

<h6>Artur, how did you approach PostgreSQL</h6>

>I was the second developer hired by the company I work for and, at that early stage, we had lots of decisions to make. One of them was which database to use and our choices narrowed down to either MySQL or PostgreSQL.

>Both would work fine, but PostgreSQL proved to be more robust and ideal for what we wanted. It would be easier for the teams that were going to work with it and the performance was good.

>We didn't plan for it at the time, but, as a plus, we gained the best geolocation plugin ever by choosing PostgreSQL: PostGIS. It opened a new field to work on that changed the intelligence behind our products.

<h6>Artur, why did you decide to participate at PGDay.IT?</h6>

>Geolocation was so important to us that I have been trying for a while to talk about it at conferences. Mostly, I have been looking at Ruby on Rails conferences, because that's the programming language and framework we use, but at some point, I realized that it was strongly related to PostgreSQL and that I could present a PostGIS case in a conference like PGDay.

>I found it on the Internet and sent the proposal to speak, and now I am really glad my proposal was accepted. There is also something very special about this conference: I am Brazilian, but my family has roots it Italy and it will be a huge honor for me to go back to my grandfather's country and present something that can be useful to other people there.

<h6>Artur, could you tell us three adjectives to define and recommend PostgreSQL?</h6>

>Reliable, robust and powerful.
